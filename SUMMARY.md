**Cattle Detection and Counting in UAV Images Based on Convolutional Neural Networks** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the livestock industry, and in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 670 images with 1949 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cattle*).

Images in the Cattle Detection and Counting in UAV Images dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 340 (51% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *Dataset1* (656 images) and *Dataset2* (14 images). Additionally, every object contains information about ***cattle id***, ***quality label*** (Normal, Truncated, Blurred, or Occluded), ***id conf*** (lack of confidence or high confidence). Explore them in supervisely. The dataset was released in 2020 by the The University of Tokyo, Data61-CSIRO, and Kamiens Technology Inc.
